# Blackjack
Object oriented approach in Python to a blackjack simulator for a graduate level class assignment.

This program, blackjack3.py, runs via the command line in which the argument that is passed is the number of simulations you wish to run. i.e.
python3 blackjack3.py 100

The output of the file is the percentage of wins corresponding to each player/dealer strategy that is played over the number of simulations.

In addition, there is a preliminary file of test cases that was written in order to test the program, which is under test_blackjack3.py.
