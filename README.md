# Blackjack
Object oriented approach in Python for a blackjack simulator that calculates percentage of wins based on soft or hard hand strategy.

This program, blackjack3.py, runs via the command line in which the argument that is passed is the number of simulations you wish to run. i.e.
python3 blackjack3.py 100

In addition, there is a preliminary file of test cases that was written in order to test the program, which is under test_blackjack3.py. This was for a graduate class assignment.
